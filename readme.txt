This is most likely because this plugin can not reach your electroneum-wallet-rpc. Make sure that you have supplied the correct host IP and port to the plugin in their fields. If your electroneum-wallet-rpc is on a different server than your wordpress site, make sure that the appropriate port is open with port forwarding enabled.
